# WEATHER-DATA-ANALYSIS

This project, "WEATHER DATA ANALYSIS.ipynb", is a Python-based data analysis project that utilizes the pandas library to explore and analyze a weather dataset. It includes steps for data loading, initial data inspection, checking for null values, column renaming, and performing various data queries such as:

* Identifying unique weather conditions and wind speeds.
* Calculating the mean visibility and standard deviation of pressure.
* Filtering data to find specific weather patterns, like clear weather with high relative humidity.

This repository serves as a practical example of data manipulation and analysis techniques applied to meteorological data.
